                                <p>There is a romance around strawberries.
                                     Along with mulberry, gooseberry and raspberry, 
                                     over 85 % of the country’s produce comes from Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani. 
                                     These fruits were brought here by the British from Australia and the locals have 
                                     adopted the practises of cultivating here. Agro tourism is one of the main reasons 
                                     why tourists flock to Mahabaleshwar. If you are planning to pluck strawberries, then 
                                     look for several Mahabaleshwar hotels which will facilitate it for you or you can stay 
                                     in one of the farms as well

                                     which are some of the best places to see in Mahabaleshwar.  The Elephant Point located near Kate’s Point is
                                      also called Needle’s Point as it’s a natural rock formation that has a thin hole in between. Some say it also
                                       looks like an elephant’s trunk and hence the name.
